Mostly it is used as a container which contains other object classes under it.
e.g when we branch out indevisual people and group name use OU.
2)organisation object class -> RDN=O, one level up with OU.
3) Country object class -> RDN=C, one level up O.
4) PosixAccount -> RDN=UID used to store infomation partaing to a user,
use in every directory sture use to store indivisul informatin
5) PosixGroup -> RDN=CN - used to store indivusal group detail, usualy referred with UID attribute. e.g dev team and systemadmin team.

e.g CN=dev and CN=adim.
2)Userid(UID) - imp attribute, used at last level in direcotry structure,use to save user entity.used aroub four object classes.
